## ‚å®Ô∏è Usage

To use BashSenpai, run the following command:

```shell
senpai [options] prompt
```

The `prompt` argument represents the question you want to ask or a special command you wish to execute. BashSenpai sends the prompt to the BashSenpai API and displays the response in your terminal.

### Examples

* Login to BashSenpai:

```shell
senpai login
```

This prompt asks you to enter an authentication token, storing it in the configuration file.

* Change the persona of BashSenpai:

```shell
senpai become angry pirate
```

This prompt alters BashSenpai's persona to an angry pirate, infusing a fun twist into the responses. You are not confined to a specific list of characters and can input anything you desire. Our ingeniously designed backend API, equipped with multi-level prompts and instructions, ensures all eccentric ideas are nicely integrated with the core functionality of the tool.

* Ask a question:

```shell
senpai how to disable SSH connections
```

This prompt sends the question to the BashSenpai API and displays an informative and well-formatted response.

* Ask for a command explanation:

```shell
senpai explain tar
```

This prompt sends a question about a specific command to the BashSenpai API and displays a list of most common use cases along with informative comments and remarks of what each one does.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Options

* `--command-color`: sets the color of the commands in the responses. Valid options are: black, white, gray, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta and cyan. Brighter versions of each color are available, for example: "bright blue". You can also bold colors, for example: "bold red" or "bold bright cyan".

* `--comment-color`: sets the color of the comments in the responses.

* `--meta`, `--no-meta`: determines whether to send OS metadata to refine the responses. This includes OS type and version (all OSes), shell type (macOS and Linux), and architecture (macOS). Users may choose to disable this feature for privacy reasons, or in cases where it yields undesired results (for example if the tool is operating on a Windows machine, but the user expects answers about Linux).

* `-n, --new`: excludes any preceding history when asking a question. Use this option to initiate a new context.

* `--run`, `--no-run`: controls whether to display the menu prompt to execute each returned command.

* `-v`, `--version`: shows current version number.
